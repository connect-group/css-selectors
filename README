A Java Thymeleaf/Thymesheet implementation of the W3C Selectors Level 3 specification, forked from https://github.com/chrsan/css-selectors

Originally coded by Christer Sandberg; original README follows:-

The code for this implementation is influenced by all the JavaScript versions
out there, and the one used in WebKit. Thanks to all the developers for inspiring me.

The scanner/parser was made using the wonderful Ragel State Machine Compiler by Adrian Thurston.
You can find out more about Ragel at http://www.complang.org/ragel/.

I hope that you'll find this project useful!?
